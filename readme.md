# Susa
## Networked web game framework

  - [**Roadmap**](https://trello.com/b/MGlfhN1a/susa-roadmap) — glean into Susa's future.

Susa is:

  - Currently in early development.
  - A high level framework for online multiplayer action web games.
  - A platform and workflow for rapid web game development.

Overarching goals:

  - Online multiplayer action via WebRTC (RTCDataChannel).
  - Realtime collaborative map editing experience.
  - Built on [BabylonJS](http://www.babylonjs.com/) — 3D web game engine.

Susa's development is intertwined with its sister project, [Nanoshooter](https://github.com/AkkadianGames/Nanoshooter#readme), and is typically developed on as a submodule within the Nanoshooter project. We're keeping Susa and Nanoshooter's development workflow tightly integrated during these early stages, though are maintaining separated repositories, roadmaps, issue tracking, and versioning.
